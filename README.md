## General Information
- The company is trying to reach a decision whether to give a loan to a certain individual or not, thus reducing two types of risks: 
    - If the person is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan will result in loss of business 
    - If the person is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan will result in financial loss 

## Conclusion & Recommendations
- Scenarios where customers defaulted:
        - Customers with 'Mortgages home' and higher annual income in year 2008 - defaulted the most.
        - Customers with 'Mortgages home' and higher annual income in year 2011 - defaulted the most.
        - Customers with 'Other home' with higher Loan Amount in year 2011 - defaulted the most.
        - For customers with 'Mortgages home'; Funded Invoiced Amount, Number of Instalments, Rate of Interest, Loan Amount, Revolving Line Utilization Rate rapidly increased every year. Thus increasing the chances of rate of 'Defaults'

Scenarios where loan was fully paid
• In year 2007 customers with 'Highest Income' FULLY_PAID the loan in 'renewable energy' sector.
• In year 2009 customers with 'Highest Income' FULLY_PAID the loan in 'renewable energy' sector.
