## General Information
- The company is trying to reach a decision whether to give a loan to a certain individual or not, thus reducing two types of risks: 
    - If the person is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan will result in loss of business 
    - If the person is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan will result in financial loss 

## Observations
- Scenarios where customers defaulted:
    - Customers with 'Mortgages home' and higher annual income in year 2008 - defaulted the most.
    - Customers with 'Mortgages home' and higher annual income in year 2011 - defaulted the most.
    - Customers with 'Other home' with higher Loan Amount in year 2011 - defaulted the most.
    - For customers with 'Mortgages home'; Funded Invoiced Amount, Number of Instalments, Rate of Interest, Loan Amount, Revolving Line Utilization Rate rapidly increased every year. Thus increasing the chances of rate of 'Defaults'

- Scenarios where loan was fully paid
    - In year 2007 customers with 'Highest Income' FULLY_PAID the loan in 'renewable energy' sector.
    - In year 2009 customers with 'Highest Income' FULLY_PAID the loan in 'renewable energy' sector.

- Customers with highest income lived in all types of homes.
    - Customer's Annual Income is highest where they have a 'mortgaged home' and loan application was verified.
    - Customer's Annual Income is highest where they have a 'Other home' and loan application was Source verified.
    - Customer's Annual Income is highest where they have a 'Own home' and loan application was verified.
    - Customer's Annual Income is highest where they have a 'Rented home' and loan application was verified.
